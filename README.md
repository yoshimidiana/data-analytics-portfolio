# Data Analytics Portfolio  

A starter portfolio for data analytics showcasing three core skills: SQL queries, Python data analysis, and business intelligence/visualization using Tableau or another BI tool.  

## Repository Structure  
- `sql_queries/` – contains sample SQL scripts demonstrating typical analytical queries.  
- `python_analysis/` – includes a Python script illustrating exploratory data analysis with pandas.  
- `tableau_bi/` – outlines a BI/dashboard project with instructions for building a simple visualization in Tableau or any BI platform.  

## Getting Started  
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.  
   `git clone https://github.com/yoshimidiana/data-analytics-portfolio.git`  

2. Explore the `sql_queries` folder to view example SQL statements. You can run these against your own database to practice writing and optimizing queries.  

3. Review the `python_analysis` folder for a basic data analysis script. The script reads a CSV file into pandas, performs descriptive statistics, and outputs a simple plot. To run it, ensure you have Python and pandas installed, then execute:  
   `python python_analysis/data_analysis.py`  

4. In the `tableau_bi` folder you'll find an outline (markdown) for creating a BI dashboard. Use it as a guide to create a dashboard in Tableau or your preferred BI tool.  

## Contributing  

Feel free to expand these starter projects with your own datasets or visualizations. Pull requests are welcome to improve queries, add notebooks or dashboards, or enhance the README.
