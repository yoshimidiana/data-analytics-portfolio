# Business Intelligence Dashboard Outline  \n\nThis document outlines a simple BI/dashboard project using Tableau or your preferred BI tool.  \n\n## Project Overview  \n- **Objective:** Create a dashboard that visualizes sales data to highlight key trends and performance indicators.  \n- **Dataset:** Use a CSV file (e.g., `data/sales_data.csv`) containing fields such as order date, region, product category, revenue, and profit.  \n\n## Steps to Build the Dashboard  \n1. **Import Data:** Load the dataset into Tableau or your BI tool.  \n2. **Clean & Prepare:** Ensure the data types are correct, handle missing values, and create any calculated fields (e.g., year, month).  \n3. **Create Visualizations:**  \n   - **Time Series:** Line chart showing revenue over time (monthly or quarterly).  \n   - **Category Breakdown:** Bar chart comparing revenue by product category.  \n   - **Geographic View:** Map view (if geographic data is available) showing sales by region.  \n   - **KPIs:** Summary cards for total revenue, total orders, and average order value.  \n4. **Interactivity:** Add filters for date range, region, or category to allow users to explore the data.  \n5. **Dashboard Layout:** Arrange the visualizations on a single dashboard, ensuring clear labels and titles.  \n6. **Publish/Share:** Export the dashboard to Tableau Public or your BI server and include instructions for accessing it.  \n\n## Usage  \n- Place your dataset in the `data/` directory of this repository.  \n- Follow the steps above to build your dashboard.  \n- Save the Tableau workbook (`.twb` or `.twbx`) or BI project file in the `tableau_bi/` directory for future reference.  \n
